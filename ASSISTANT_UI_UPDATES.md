## Summary of Changes

All requested changes have been successfully implemented in `AssistantView.swift`. The updates include:

---

## 1. ✅ Dynamic Circular Mic Listening Animation

**What Changed:**

- Created a modern circular mic icon with dynamic animation rings

**Features:**

  - Middle ring (140px)  
  - Outer ring (180px)
- **Animation effects**:
  - Rings scale from 1.0 to 1.5x
  - Rings fade from 60%/40%/20% opacity to 0%
  - Continuous animation with staggered delays (0s, 0.5s, 1.0s)
  - Mic icon pulses subtly (1.0 to 1.1 scale)
- **Semi-transparent overlay**: Black background with 30% opacity
- **Clear instructions**: "Listening..." title with "Tap anywhere to stop" subtitle
