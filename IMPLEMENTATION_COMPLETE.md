## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Automated Testing:
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ No warnings generated
- ⚠️  Unit tests not added (camera operations difficult to unit test)

### Manual Testing Required:
- [ ] Subtitle toggle on device
- [ ] Camera first-time permission flow
- [ ] Camera with existing permission
- [ ] Settings recovery flow
- [ ] Error handling and retry
- [ ] Performance and smoothness

**Recommendation**: Focus on manual testing on physical device. Camera functionality cannot be fully tested in simulator.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Technical Limitations:
1. **Simulator**: Camera preview may not work (expected)
2. **iOS System Delay**: ~1s delay after permission grant (iOS behavior)
3. **Background Mode**: Camera suspends in background (iOS limitation)
4. **Other App Using Camera**: Session start may fail (expected)

### Future Improvements:
1. Add unit tests for permission state machine
2. Add analytics tracking for KPIs
3. Add haptic feedback on button taps
4. Add more detailed error messages for specific failures
5. Consider adding camera flash toggle
6. Consider adding camera zoom controls

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### If Issues Arise:

**Check Console Logs**:
```bash
# Filter logs in Xcode
[CameraService]  # Camera-related logs
[LiveAI]         # View lifecycle logs
```

**Common Issues**:
1. **Camera not starting**: Check Settings → Camera permission
2. **Jerky animations**: Check device performance (older devices may lag)
3. **Permission dialog not showing**: Reset privacy settings
4. **Crashes on launch**: Verify Info.plist descriptions exist

**Debugging Tools**:
- Xcode console for logs
- Instruments for performance profiling
- Memory graph debugger for retain cycles
- View hierarchy debugger for layout issues
