# Final Solution: Fixing the "unable to load transferred PIF" Error

## Overview

You're encountering the error:
```
Could not compute dependency graph: unable to load transferred PIF: The workspace contains multiple references with the same GUID 'PACKAGE:1VVAAQN25J7QI0AC1GQK1QB8YD93ZPYW5::MAINGROUP'
```

This is typically caused by duplicate package references in your Xcode project. Since our automated scripts weren't able to fix the issue completely, here's a manual approach that should resolve the problem.

## Step-by-Step Manual Solution

### 1. Close Xcode Completely

Make sure Xcode is completely closed before proceeding.

### 2. Clean Derived Data

Run this command in Terminal:
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Agrisense-*
```

### 3. Clean Swift Package Manager Cache

Run this command in Terminal:
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm/
```

### 4. Create a New Xcode Project (Recommended)

The most reliable way to fix this issue is to create a new Xcode project:

1. Create a new iOS App project named "Agrisense"
2. Copy all your source files to the new project
3. Add the Firebase package dependencies with the correct versions:
   - Firebase iOS SDK: version 10.15.0 (not 12.1.0)
   - GoogleSignIn-iOS: version 7.0.0

### 5. Alternative: Fix in Xcode UI

If you prefer not to create a new project:

1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Go to the Project Navigator
3. Select your project (not a target)
4. Click on the "Package Dependencies" tab
5. Remove all existing package dependencies
6. Click the "+" button to add packages
7. Add the Firebase iOS SDK (https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git) and specify version 10.15.0
8. Add GoogleSignIn-iOS (https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS) and specify version 7.0.0
9. Add any other necessary packages with specific versions

### 6. Update Specific Firebase Products

After adding the Firebase package, make sure to select only the specific Firebase products you need:

- FirebaseAnalytics
- FirebaseAuth
- FirebaseFirestore
- FirebaseStorage
- Any other specific Firebase products your app uses

### Important Notes

1. **Version Mismatch**: The error might be occurring because you're trying to use Firebase 12.1.0, which may not be available. Stick to stable releases like 10.15.0.

2. **Xcode Version**: Make sure your Xcode version is compatible with the Firebase SDK version you're using.

3. **Manual Editing**: Avoid manually editing the project.pbxproj file as it can easily become corrupted.

4. **Multiple References**: This error occurs when the same package is referenced multiple times in the project file with the same GUID.

## After Fixing

After applying these fixes, build your project using:

```bash
xcodebuild -project Agrisense.xcodeproj -scheme Agrisense -sdk iphonesimulator -configuration Debug build
```
