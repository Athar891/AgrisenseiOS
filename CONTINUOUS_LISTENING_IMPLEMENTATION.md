# Continuous Listening & Interrupt Implementation

## Overview
The Live AI Assistant now supports **continuous listening** with **real-time interrupt capability**, providing a natural conversational experience similar to ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode.

## Key Features

### 1. **Continuous Listening**
- Voice transcription remains active throughout the entire session
- The assistant is always ready to receive user input
- No need to manually activate listening after each response

### 2. **Real-Time Interruption**
- User can interrupt the AI at any time while it's responding
- When user starts speaking, TTS immediately stops
- The system switches to listening mode and processes the new input
- Old responses are discarded when interrupted

### 3. **Auto-Processing**
- Detects when user stops speaking (1.2 seconds of silence)
- Automatically processes the input without manual triggers
- Visual feedback shows "Listening" state when user speaks

### 4. **Seamless State Transitions**
```
Standby (Ready/Listening) ‚Üí User Speaks ‚Üí Listening ‚Üí 
User Stops ‚Üí Thinking ‚Üí AI Responds ‚Üí Responding ‚Üí 
Response Complete ‚Üí Back to Standby (Ready/Listening)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Changes to `LiveAIService.swift`

#### 1. Enhanced Transcription Monitoring
```swift
private func setupTranscriptionMonitoring() {
    // Monitors transcription changes every 0.1s
    // Detects user speech and interrupts TTS immediately
    // Provides visual feedback for listening state
}
```

#### 2. Improved Speaker Response Method
```swift
private func speakResponse(_ text: String, quick: Bool = false) async {
    // Pauses voice recording during TTS
    // Waits for TTS to complete OR be interrupted
    // IMMEDIATELY resumes voice recording for continuous listening
    // Clears accumulated transcription
}
```

#### 3. Optimized Auto-Processing
```swift
private func startAutoProcessing() {
    // Reduced silence threshold to 1.2s (from 1.5s) for faster response
    // Visual feedback when user starts speaking
    // Won't process while AI is speaking (prevents feedback loops)
    // Automatic state management
}
```

#### 4. Continuous Listening Verification
- After each AI response, verifies voice recording is still active
- Automatically restarts recording if it stopped unexpectedly
- After errors, ensures continuous listening resumes

### Changes to `VoiceTranscriptionService.swift`

#### Enhanced Pause/Resume
```swift
func resumeRecording() async {
    // Longer stabilization delay (150ms) for better reliability
    // Automatic restart if resume fails
    // Better error handling
}

private func restartRecording() async {
    // Fallback method when pause/resume fails
    // Ensures continuous listening continues
}
```

### Changes to `LiveAIInteractionView.swift`

#### Status Text Updates
- Shows "Ready (Listening)" when in standby with active recording
- Provides clear visual feedback that system is listening
- User knows they can speak at any time

### Localization Updates

Added new string in `en.lproj/Localizable.strings`:
```
"live_ai_listening_continuous" = "Ready (Listening)";
```

## User Experience Flow

### Starting a Session
1. User opens Live AI Interaction
2. System starts continuous listening
3. Status shows "Ready (Listening)"
4. AI greets user: "hi" ‚Üí "how can I help you"

### Normal Conversation
1. User speaks: "What should I plant in monsoon?"
2. Status changes to "Listening" (visual feedback)
3. User stops speaking (1.2s silence)
4. Status changes to "Thinking"
5. AI processes and responds
6. Status changes to "Responding"
7. AI finishes speaking
8. Status returns to "Ready (Listening)"
9. **Voice recording is already active - user can speak immediately**

### Interrupting AI
1. AI is responding: "In monsoon season, you should consider..."
2. User starts speaking: "What about wheat?"
3. **AI IMMEDIATELY STOPS speaking**
4. Status changes to "Listening"
5. System processes new question about wheat
6. Previous response is discarded

## Benefits

### For Users
‚úÖ Natural conversation flow - just like talking to a person
‚úÖ No waiting for AI to finish before asking next question
‚úÖ Fast response times (reduced silence threshold)
‚úÖ Clear visual feedback of system state
‚úÖ No manual button presses needed

### For Developers
‚úÖ Robust error handling with automatic recovery
‚úÖ State management prevents race conditions
‚úÖ Comprehensive logging for debugging
‚úÖ Modular design for easy maintenance

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Reduced Silence Threshold**: 1.2s instead of 1.5s for faster processing
2. **Audio Session Management**: Proper pause/resume prevents audio conflicts
3. **State Verification**: Checks and restarts voice recording if needed
4. **Interrupt Detection**: 0.1s polling rate for near-instant interruption

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios

1. **Basic Conversation**
   - Start session
   - Ask multiple questions in sequence
   - Verify continuous listening between responses

2. **Interrupt Test**
   - Ask a question
   - While AI is responding, interrupt with new question
   - Verify AI stops immediately and processes new input

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Test with background noise
   - Test rapid successive questions
   - Test long pauses between words
   - Test error recovery (force network error)

4. **Multi-Turn Context**
   - Ask related questions
   - Verify AI remembers conversation context
   - Test interrupt in middle of multi-turn conversation

## Debugging

### Key Log Messages
```
üöÄ Starting Live AI Session
üìù Continuous listening enabled
üé§ User started speaking
üé§ User interrupted AI - stopping TTS immediately
üéØ Silence threshold reached - processing user input
‚úÖ Ready for next user input (continuous listening active)
‚ö†Ô∏è Voice recording stopped unexpectedly - restarting
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Voice recording stops after response
**Solution**: Check `speakResponse()` - ensure `resumeRecording()` is called

**Issue**: Interrupt doesn't work
**Solution**: Check `setupTranscriptionMonitoring()` - ensure TTS stop is called

**Issue**: System processes input while AI is speaking
**Solution**: Check auto-processing - ensure `!ttsService.isSpeaking` check exists

## Future Enhancements

1. **Adjustable Silence Threshold**: Let users customize response speed
2. **Wake Word During Response**: Allow wake word to interrupt
3. **Multi-Language Support**: Continuous listening in regional languages
4. **Audio Level Visualization**: Show real-time audio input levels
5. **Background Listening**: Continue listening when app is in background (with user permission)

## Conclusion

The Live AI Assistant now provides a seamless, conversational experience with continuous listening and real-time interrupt capability. Users can speak naturally without worrying about button presses or waiting for the AI to finish before asking the next question.
