# Language Change Fix Summary

## Problem
When users changed the language in the app, the changes were not applied instantly. Users had to restart the app for the new language to take effect.

## Root Cause
The views were using `LocalizationManager.shared.localizedString(for: key)` directly but were not observing the LocalizationManager as an `@ObservedObject` or through the environment. This meant that when the language changed, SwiftUI views didn't get notified to update their UI.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated LocalizationManager
- Improved the `setLanguage` method to properly notify SwiftUI views using `DispatchQueue.main.async { self.objectWillChange.send() }`
- Added SwiftUI extensions for better integration
- Created a `LocalizedText` view component for automatic updates

### 2. Updated App Architecture
- Modified `AgrisenseApp.swift` to provide `LocalizationManager.shared` as an environment object
- All views now have access to the localization manager through `@EnvironmentObject`

### 3. Updated All Views
Updated the following view files to observe the LocalizationManager:
- `ProfileView.swift` - Including the `LanguageSelectionSheet`
- `DashboardView.swift`
- `MarketplaceView.swift`
- `CommunityView.swift`
- `AssistantView.swift`
- `AuthenticationView.swift`
- `SignInView.swift`
- `SignupView.swift`
- `SoilTestView.swift`
- `AddCropView.swift`
- `MarketPricesView.swift`
- `CropDetailView.swift`
- `CartView.swift`

### 4. Pattern Changes
- Changed from `LocalizationManager.shared.localizedString(for: key)` to `localizationManager.localizedString(for: key)`
- Added `@EnvironmentObject var localizationManager: LocalizationManager` to all relevant views
- Updated the `LanguageSelectionSheet` to properly sync with the environment object

## How It Works Now

1. User selects a new language in the language selection sheet
2. `localizationManager.setLanguage(code: selectedCode)` is called
3. LocalizationManager updates its internal state and calls `objectWillChange.send()`
4. All views observing the LocalizationManager automatically refresh
5. All localized strings throughout the app update instantly

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `Agrisense/CoreKit/LocalizationManager.swift`
- `Agrisense/AgrisenseApp.swift`

### View Files
- `Agrisense/Views/Profile/ProfileView.swift`
- `Agrisense/Views/Dashboard/DashboardView.swift`
- `Agrisense/Views/Dashboard/SoilTestView.swift`
- `Agrisense/Views/Dashboard/AddCropView.swift`
- `Agrisense/Views/Dashboard/MarketPricesView.swift`
- `Agrisense/Views/Dashboard/CropDetailView.swift`
- `Agrisense/Views/Marketplace/MarketplaceView.swift`
- `Agrisense/Views/Marketplace/CartView.swift`
- `Agrisense/Views/Community/CommunityView.swift`
- `Agrisense/Views/Assistant/AssistantView.swift`
- `Agrisense/Views/Authentication/AuthenticationView.swift`
- `Agrisense/Views/Authentication/SignInView.swift`
- `Agrisense/Views/Authentication/SignupView.swift`

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Run the app
2. Navigate to Profile > Language Settings
3. Select a different language (e.g., Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu)
4. Observe that all UI text updates immediately without requiring an app restart
5. Navigate between different tabs to verify all views update correctly

## Key Benefits
- ✅ Instant language switching without app restart
- ✅ Consistent UI updates across all views
- ✅ Proper SwiftUI reactive patterns
- ✅ Maintains app performance
- ✅ Better user experience

The language change issue has been completely resolved and the app now provides instant language switching across all screens.
