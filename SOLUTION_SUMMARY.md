# Final Solution Summary

## Issue Analysis

After analyzing your Xcode project, we've identified that:

1. Your project has package references to Firebase and GoogleSignIn
2. The error "unable to load transferred PIF: The workspace contains multiple references with the same GUID 'PACKAGE:1VVAAQN25J7QI0AC1GQK1QB8YD93ZPYW5::MAINGROUP'" indicates duplicate references to the same package in your project

## Root Cause

The issue is likely due to:
1. The Firebase SDK version (12.1.0) that isn't available or has compatibility issues
2. Duplicate references to the same package in the project file

## Solution Steps

### Option 1: Use Xcode UI (Recommended)

1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Go to Project Navigator and select your project (not a target)
3. Click on the "Package Dependencies" tab
4. Remove all existing package dependencies
5. Click the "+" button to add packages
6. Add Firebase iOS SDK (https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git) with version 10.15.0
7. Add GoogleSignIn-iOS (https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS) with version 7.0.0
8. Select the specific Firebase products your app needs
9. Build and run your project

### Option 2: Create a New Project

If Option 1 doesn't work:

1. Create a new iOS App project named "Agrisense"
2. Copy all your source files to the new project
3. Add the required packages with specific versions
4. Configure your project settings to match your original project

## Preventing This Issue

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. Always use specific version numbers for Swift packages
2. Use the Xcode UI to add/remove packages, not manual edits
3. Keep your Xcode and Swift packages updated
