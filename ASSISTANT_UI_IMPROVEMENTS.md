# Assistant View UI Improvements

## Summary
Three key improvements have been made to the Assistant View to enhance the user experience.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Removed Leaf Icon from Splash Screen
**File Modified:** `Agrisense/Views/Components/SplashScreenView.swift`

**Change:** Removed the decorative leaf icon from the startup/splash screen, keeping only the "Agrisense" gradient text title and subtitle.

**Before:**
```swift
VStack(spacing: 20) {
    Image(systemName: "leaf.fill")
        .font(.system(size: 60))
        .foregroundColor(.green)
    
    Text("Agrisense")
        ...
}
```

**After:**
```swift
VStack(spacing: 20) {
    // "Agrisense" title with gradient animation
    Text("Agrisense")
        ...
}
```

### 2. ✅ Transparent Listening Overlay
**File Modified:** `Agrisense/Views/Assistant/AssistantView.swift`

**Change:** The listening animation now appears as a fully transparent overlay that covers the entire screen, hovering above the AI Assistant window without blocking the view.

**Before:**
```swift
if isListening {
    CircularMicListeningOverlay()
        .transition(.opacity)
}
```

**After:**
```swift
if isListening {
    ZStack {
        Color.clear
            .ignoresSafeArea()
        
        CircularMicListeningOverlay()
    }
    .transition(.opacity)
}
```

**Features:**
- Transparent background that doesn't obstruct the assistant view
- Covers the entire screen area
- Maintains the animated microphone visualization
- Can be dismissed by tapping anywhere

### 3. ✅ Proper Markdown Formatting for AI Output
**File Modified:** `Agrisense/Views/Assistant/AssistantView.swift`

**Change:** Added a new `FormattedMarkdownText` component that properly parses and formats AI responses by:
- Removing raw markdown characters (like `*` and `**`)
- Applying **bold** formatting for text wrapped in `**text**`
- Applying *italic* formatting for text wrapped in `*text*`
- Preserving line breaks and text structure

**New Component Added:**
```swift
struct FormattedMarkdownText: View {
    let content: String
    
    var body: some View {
        let formatted = formatMarkdown(content)
        return formatted
    }
    
    private func formatMarkdown(_ text: String) -> Text {
        // Parses markdown syntax and applies SwiftUI Text styling
        ...
    }
}
```

**Features:**
- Automatically detects and formats bold text (`**text**`)
- Automatically detects and formats italic text (`*text*`)
- Removes markdown markers from display
- Preserves natural text flow and readability
- Works with multi-line responses

**Example:**
- **Input:** `"This is **bold** and this is *italic* text"`
- **Output:** "This is **bold** and this is *italic* text" (with proper styling)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Splash Screen:** Launch the app to verify the leaf icon is removed
2. **Listening Mode:** 
   - Tap the microphone button
   - Verify the overlay is transparent
   - Check that the assistant view is visible underneath
3. **AI Responses:**
   - Send a query to the AI assistant
   - Verify markdown characters are not displayed
   - Confirm bold and italic formatting is applied correctly
